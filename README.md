# Mapping Earthquakes

This repository contains .json files and .js files for the purpose of practicing displaying data on maps and adding stylistic elements. This all culminates into a project saved under the [Earthquake_Challenge folder](https://github.com/teruki-i/Mapping_Earthquakes/tree/main/Earthquake_Challenge). This folder contains the following:
1. A Javascript file that:
   - Displays maps provided by an API request to Mapbox
   - Displays earthquake data provided by the USGS
   - Displays techtonic plate boundaries, using data provided by fraxen's [tectonicplates](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates) Github repository
   - Adds interactive elements to the elements using the Leaflet library
2. A CSS file for stylistic elements.
3. An HTML file that renders the above Javascript and CSS files.
